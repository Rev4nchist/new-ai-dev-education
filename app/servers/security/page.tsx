      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to MCP Server Security</h2>
      <p>
        Security is a critical aspect of any MCP server implementation. MCP servers handle sensitive 
        code, project details, and proprietary information that must be protected. This guide covers 
        essential security measures and best practices.
      </p>
      
      <Callout type="warning" title="Security First">
        Security should never be an afterthought. Integrate security considerations from the beginning
        of your MCP server development process.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        Authentication verifies the identity of users and systems accessing your MCP server. It is your
        first line of defense against unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>
      <p>
        Authorization determines what authenticated users can access or modify. A robust authorization 
        system is essential for protecting sensitive context data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed without authorization, it remains
        unreadable without the proper decryption keys.
      </p>

      <h2 id="secure-deployment">Secure Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        Security extends beyond code to how you deploy and operate your MCP server in production environments.
      </p>

      <h2 id="monitoring">Security Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        Continuous monitoring helps detect and respond to security incidents quickly, minimizing potential damage.
      </p>

      <h2 id="best-practices">Security Best Practices</h2>
      <p>
        Follow these recommended practices to maintain a secure MCP server implementation.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Securing your MCP server requires attention at every stage of development and operation.
