          <h2>Introduction to AI-Assisted Development</h2>
          <p>
            AI-assisted development represents a paradigm shift in how software is created, 
            leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance developer productivity, creativity, 
            and code quality. Unlike traditional programming where developers write every line 
            of code, AI-assisted development introduces an intelligent collaborator that can 
            understand context, suggest solutions, and automate repetitive tasks.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> - AI systems trained on vast amounts 
              of code and text that can understand and generate programming languages
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Context Management</strong> - The process of providing and maintaining the 
              right information for the AI to understand the programming task
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Context Protocol</strong> - A standardized approach for managing and 
              sharing context between different AI development tools
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI-Human Collaboration</strong> - A workflow where AI and developers work 
              together, each contributing their unique strengths
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Types of AI Development Assistance</h2>
          <p>
            AI can assist development in various ways, from code completion to more advanced 
            forms of collaboration:
          </p>

          <h3>Code Completion and Generation</h3>
          <p>
            The most common form of AI assistance, where the AI suggests or generates code 
            based on comments, function signatures, or existing code patterns.
          </p>

          <h3>Code Explanation and Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            AI can analyze existing code to explain its functionality, generate comments, 
            or create documentation for complex systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Automated Refactoring</h3>
          <p>
            AI can suggest improvements to code structure, identify potential bugs, and 
            even implement refactoring changes automatically.
          </p>

          <h3>Test Generation</h3>
          <p>
            AI can analyze code and generate test cases to ensure proper functionality 
            and edge case handling.
          </p>

          <h2>The Evolution of AI-Assisted Development</h2>
          <p>
            AI assistance in development has evolved rapidly in recent years:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Early systems provided simple autocomplete functionality</li>
            <li>Current systems can understand project-wide context and generate complex solutions</li>
            <li>Emerging systems can actively participate in problem-solving and architectural decisions</li>
          </ul>
