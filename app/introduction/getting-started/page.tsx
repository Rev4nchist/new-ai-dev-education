      <h2 id="first-steps">First Steps with AI Assistance</h2>
      <p>
        Start with these basic interactions to become familiar with AI-assisted development:
      </p>

      <h3 id="code-completion">Using Code Completion</h3>
      <p>
        Code completion is the most basic form of AI assistance, suggesting the next lines 
        as you type:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start typing a function or method</li>
        <li>Observe inline suggestions appearing</li>
        <li>Press Tab or the assigned key to accept suggestions</li>
        <li>Use Escape or continue typing to ignore suggestions</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="code-generation">Generating Code with Natural Language</h3>
      <p>
        Many AI tools can generate code based on natural language descriptions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add a comment describing what you want to implement<br />
          <code>// Create a function that validates email addresses using regex</code>
        </li>
        <li>Press Enter or the tool's generation shortcut</li>
        <li>Review the generated code and modify as needed</li>
      </ol>

      <CodeBlock 
        language="javascript"
        filename="example-generation.js"
        code={`// Create a function that validates email addresses using regex
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}

// Test the function with different emails
console.log(validateEmail('test@example.com')); // true
console.log(validateEmail('invalid-email')); // false
console.log(validateEmail('test@example')); // false (missing top-level domain)`}
      />

      <h3 id="code-explanation">Getting Code Explanations</h3>
      <p>
        AI tools can help you understand unfamiliar code:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the code you want to understand</li>
        <li>Use the explain or chat feature of your AI tool</li>
        <li>Ask follow-up questions to clarify specific aspects</li>

      <p>
        The quality of AI-generated code largely depends on your prompts. Use these strategies 
        to write effective prompts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Be specific and detailed</strong> - Include requirements, edge cases, and expected behavior
          <br />
          <code>{"// Implement a pagination function that takes an array of items, page number, and page size. \n// It should handle empty arrays and return the correct page of items along with metadata about total pages."}</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide context</strong> - Include relevant information about your project, frameworks, or patterns
          <br />
          <code>{"// In our React + TypeScript project using the repository pattern, implement a user service \n// that handles authentication with our Firebase backend"}</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Specify format and style</strong> - Request code that follows your project's conventions
          <br />
          <code>{"// Using our functional programming approach with immutability, implement a data \n// transformation function that converts the API response to our internal format"}</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use iterative prompting</strong> - Start with a basic prompt, then refine based on the response
        </li>
      </ul>
