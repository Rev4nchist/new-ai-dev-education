      <h2 id="understanding-context">Understanding Context in AI</h2>
      <p>
        Context is the information that AI models use to generate relevant and accurate responses. It shapes the AI's understanding of your project, your requirements, and the specific tasks you want it to perform. Without proper context, even the most powerful AI models can produce irrelevant or incorrect results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized framework for managing this context. However, to leverage MCP effectively, you need to understand what makes good context and how to manage it throughout your development process.
      </p>

      <h3>The Three Dimensions of Context</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Breadth:</strong> How much of your project the context covers (e.g., multiple files vs. a single function)</li>
        <li><strong>Depth:</strong> How detailed the context is (e.g., implementation details vs. high-level descriptions)</li>
        <li><strong>Recency:</strong> How up-to-date the context is with your current project state</li>
      </ul>

      <Callout type="info" title="Context Quality Matters">
        Better context leads to better AI outputs. High-quality context is relevant, concise, well-structured, and up-to-date. It provides the AI with exactly what it needs to understand your project and requirements, without overwhelming it with irrelevant information.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="context-structure">Structuring Context Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        MCP allows you to structure your context in a standardized way. A well-structured context helps the AI understand your project more clearly and generate more relevant outputs. Here's how to structure your context effectively:
      </p>

      <h3 id="project-context">Project Context</h3>
      <p>
        Project context provides an overview of your project, including its architecture, technologies, conventions, and goals. This gives the AI a high-level understanding of your project landscape.
      </p>

      />

      <h3 id="code-context">Code Context</h3>
      <p>
        Code context includes relevant code snippets, file structures, dependencies, and interfaces. This helps the AI understand the specific code it's working with.
      </p>

      />

      <h3 id="task-context">Task Context</h3>
      <p>
        Task context describes the specific task you want the AI to perform, including requirements, constraints, and any relevant history. This helps the AI understand what you're trying to achieve.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock

      />

      <Callout type="tip" title="Context Composition">
        Mix and match different types of context based on your current needs. For a new feature, combine project context (for high-level understanding), code context (for related components), and task context (for the specific feature requirements).
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="context-lifecycle">Context Lifecycle Management</h2>
      <p>
        Context isn't staticâ€”it evolves as your project progresses. Managing the context lifecycle is crucial for keeping your AI interactions relevant and efficient.
      </p>

      <h3>Context Lifecycle Stages</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Initialization:</strong> Creating the initial context based on project setup and requirements.
          <ul>
            <li>Start with essential information about your project structure and architecture</li>
            <li>Include key conventions and patterns used in your codebase</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enrichment:</strong> Expanding the context as you work on specific features or components.
          <ul>
            <li>Add relevant code snippets and files for the current task</li>
            <li>Include specific requirements and constraints</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Update:</strong> Keeping the context current as your code changes.
          <ul>
            <li>Update code snippets when files change</li>
            <li>Refresh project info when architecture or conventions evolve</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pruning:</strong> Removing outdated or irrelevant context to maintain efficiency.
          <ul>
            <li>Remove information about completed tasks</li>
            <li>Archive outdated code snippets</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Archiving:</strong> Preserving context for future reference or reuse.
          <ul>
            <li>Store successful context configurations for similar future tasks</li>
            <li>Maintain historical context for documentation purposes</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Context Version Control</h3>
      <p>
        Just like code, context benefits from version control. MCP supports versioning your context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track changes to your context over time</li>
        <li>Roll back to previous context states if needed</li>
        <li>Branch context for different features or experiments</li>
        <li>Merge context from different team members or tasks</li>
      </ul>

      <CodeBlock 
        language="typescript"
        filename="context-version-example.ts"
        code={`import { MCPClient } from '@mcp/client';

async function updateAndVersionContext() {
  const client = new MCPClient({ /* config */ });
  
  // Get the current context
  const currentContext = await client.getContext('project-123');
  
  // Create a new version with updates
  const newVersion = {
    ...currentContext,
    files: [
      ...currentContext.files,
      {
        path: 'src/components/SearchBar.tsx',
        content: '// New search bar component code...',
        purpose: 'Component for searching products'
      }
    ],
    // Update the task section
    task: {
      description: 'Implement product search with autocomplete',
      // ...more task details
    }
  };
  
  // Save as a new version
  await client.updateContext('project-123', newVersion, {
    createVersion: true,
    versionName: 'search-feature-v1'
  });
}`}
      />

      <h2 id="context-optimization">Context Optimization Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        Optimizing your context improves AI performance and reduces costs. Here are key techniques for context optimization:
      </p>

      <h3>Context Size Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevance Filtering:</strong> Include only information relevant to the current task.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Summarize large files or complex concepts rather than including everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Extraction:</strong> Extract only the most important parts of large files (e.g., interfaces, function signatures).</li>
        <li><strong>Layered Context:</strong> Maintain different levels of context (detailed for current task, summarized for related areas).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Context Freshness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Synchronization:</strong> Automatically sync context with your codebase as files change.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective Updates:</strong> Prioritize updating the most critical or frequently changing parts of your context.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Detection:</strong> Track which files have changed since the last context update.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Context Prioritization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recency Weighting:</strong> Give more weight to recently modified or accessed files.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevance Scoring:</strong> Score context elements based on their relevance to the current task.</li>
        <li><strong>Task-Based Filtering:</strong> Filter context based on the specific task requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <CodeBlock 
        language="typescript"
        filename="context-optimization.ts"
        code={`import { MCPClient } from '@mcp/client';

async function optimizeContext(taskDescription: string) {
  const client = new MCPClient({ /* config */ });
  
  // Get the current full context
  const fullContext = await client.getContext('project-123');
  
  // Analyze the task to identify relevant context
  const relevantPaths = await client.analyzeTaskRelevance(
    taskDescription,
    fullContext.files.map(f => f.path)
  );
  
  // Create an optimized context with only relevant files
  const optimizedContext = {
    ...fullContext,
    files: fullContext.files.filter(file => 
      relevantPaths.includes(file.path)
    ),
    // Update task information
    task: {
      description: taskDescription,
      // ...other task details
    }
  };
  
  // Use the optimized context
  return client.createContextSession('project-123', optimizedContext);
}`}
      />

      <Callout type="warning" title="Context Optimization Trade-offs">
        Optimization involves trade-offs. Too little context can lead to AI missing important information, while too much context can overwhelm the model or exceed token limits. Regularly review and adjust your optimization strategy based on the quality of AI outputs.
      </Callout>

      <h2 id="collaborative-context">Collaborative Context Management</h2>
      <p>

        <li>Define clear processes for updating shared context</li>
        <li>Implement review processes for context changes (similar to code reviews)</li>
        <li>Track contributions and changes to the context</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Context Synchronization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish mechanisms for synchronizing context across team members</li>
        <li>Resolve conflicts when multiple team members update the same context</li>
        <li>Create update notifications for significant context changes</li>
      </ul>

      <CodeBlock 
        language="typescript"
        filename="collaborative-context.ts"
        code={`import { MCPClient } from '@mcp/client';

async function teamContextWorkflow() {
  const client = new MCPClient({ /* config */ });
  
  // Create a feature branch of the context
  const mainContext = await client.getContext('team-project');
  const featureBranch = await client.createContextBranch('team-project', {
    branchName: 'feature/user-authentication',
    baseVersion: 'main'
  });
  
  // Make changes to the feature branch
  await client.updateContext(featureBranch.id, {
    // Add new files and task info relevant to authentication
    files: [
      ...mainContext.files,
      {
        path: 'src/components/LoginForm.tsx',
        content: '// Login form component...',
        purpose: 'User authentication form'
      }
    ],
    task: {

  });
  
  // Team lead reviews and approves the merge
  await client.mergeContextBranch('feature/user-authentication', 'main');
}`}
      />

      <h2 id="integration-patterns">Context Integration Patterns</h2>
