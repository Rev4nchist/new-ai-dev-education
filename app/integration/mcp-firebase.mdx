# Firebase MCP Server Integration

This guide covers how to integrate the Firebase MCP Server with AI assistants like Claude, GPT, or others that support the Model Context Protocol.

## What is the Firebase MCP Server?

The Firebase MCP Server is a specialized server that allows AI tools to interact directly with Firebase services, including:

- **Firestore**: Query and modify database collections
- **Authentication**: Verify user identities and manage sessions
- **Storage**: Access and retrieve files

## Why Use Firebase MCP Server?

Using the Firebase MCP Server gives AI assistants powerful abilities:

1. **Direct Database Access**: AI can retrieve real user data from your Firestore collections
2. **User Context**: AI can understand who the user is through authentication
3. **File Operations**: AI can interact with files stored in Firebase Storage

## Setting Up Firebase MCP Server

### Prerequisites

- Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled
- Service account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js environment

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gemini-dk/mcp-server-firebase
   cd mcp-server-firebase
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Configure Firebase credentials:
   - Download your service account key from Firebase Console
   - Save it as `serviceAccountKey.json` in a secure location
   - Update `mcp_settings.json` with the correct path

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Using with AI Assistants

Here are some examples of prompts that utilize the Firebase MCP Server:

### Querying Firestore Data

```
Please use the Firebase MCP Server to check the latest chat messages in the 'messages' collection. Show me the last 5 messages.
```

### Checking User Information

```
Use Firebase Authentication via MCP to check if the email 'user@example.com' is registered in our system.
```

### Accessing Files

```
Can you use the Firebase Storage MCP to list all PDF files in the 'course-materials' folder?
```

## Security Considerations

When using the Firebase MCP Server:

- Ensure your service account has only the necessary permissions
- Configure Firebase security rules appropriately
- Don't expose sensitive information in your prompts
- Consider running the MCP server in a separate environment from your main application

## Advanced Configuration

For more detailed configuration options and advanced usage scenarios, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/gemini-dk/mcp-server-firebase).

## Integration with our Platform

The AI-Dev Education Platform uses the Firebase MCP Server to enhance our chat functionality with:

- User-specific chat history retrieval
- Educational content personalization
- Progress tracking across learning modules
