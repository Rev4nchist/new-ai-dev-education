# Firebase MCP Server Integration

## Description
This PR adds integration with the Firebase MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which allows AI assistants to interact with our Firebase services. This enhances the educational platform by demonstrating practical MCP server implementation and provides enhanced AI capabilities through direct Firebase access.

## Changes
- Added the Firebase MCP Server as a submodule
- Created configuration files and setup instructions
- Added documentation about MCP server usage
- Updated package.json with commands to run the MCP server
- Added educational content about MCP integration

## Testing Done
- Verified that the MCP server can be installed and built
- Confirmed compatibility with our existing Firebase configuration
- Added documentation for testing with AI assistants

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [x] Documentation has been updated as needed
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No new warnings or errors introduced

## Additional Notes
This integration enhances our AI-Dev Education Platform by providing a practical example of MCP server implementation. Users can now see how an AI assistant can interact with Firebase services, which is a key educational component of our platform.

To test this functionality:
1. Add your Firebase service account key as described in the documentation
2. Start the MCP server with `npm run mcp:firebase`
3. Use an AI assistant like Claude to interact with your Firebase data
