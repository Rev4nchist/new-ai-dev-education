# Security Best Practices for API Key Management

This document outlines the security best practices we've followed for managing API keys in the AI Dev Education platform.

## Current Implementation

We've implemented the following security measures for handling API keys:

1. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive API keys are stored in environment variables, not in the source code.

2. **Local Environment Files**: API keys are stored in `.env.local` files which are:
   - Listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits to version control
   - Only exist on the local development machine or secure deployment environment

3. **Client-Side Protection**: The application is structured to avoid exposing API keys to the client whenever possible.

4. **Key Rotation**: API keys can be easily rotated by updating the `.env.local` file.

5. **Access Control**: For the OpenRouter API, we're using a key with the minimum necessary permissions.

## OpenRouter API Key Handling

The OpenRouter API key is currently stored in the `.env.local` file as:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Note that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix means this value is accessible in client-side code. This is necessary for the current implementation which makes direct API calls to OpenRouter from the browser.

## Future Security Enhancements

For improved security in a production environment, consider these enhancements:

1. **Server-Side Proxy**: Create a server-side API endpoint that proxies requests to OpenRouter, keeping the API key secure on the server. This would remove the need for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on your API endpoints to prevent abuse.

3. **Request Logging**: Log API requests (without the full API key) to monitor for unusual patterns.

4. **IP Restrictions**: Consider restricting API access by IP if your use case allows.

5. **Separate Development/Production Keys**: Use different API keys for development and production environments.

## Potential Vulnerabilities

Current vulnerabilities to be aware of:

1. The OpenRouter API key is accessible to client-side JavaScript code with the current implementation.

2. Browser extensions or malicious client-side code could potentially extract the API key.

3. Users could inspect network requests to see the API key in headers.

## Next Steps

- If production security is a concern, implement the server-side proxy approach described in the 'Future Security Enhancements' section.
- Set up monitoring for the API key to detect unusual usage patterns.
- Establish a regular key rotation schedule.
