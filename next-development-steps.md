# Instructions for Next Development Session

## Current Status

We've implemented a Simple Puppeteer Server (`simple-puppeteer-server.js`) that provides browser automation capabilities. The most recent commit added these Puppeteer-related files to GitHub, but they are showing as deleted in the local working directory.

## Steps to Start Development

1. **Restore Puppeteer Files from GitHub**:
   ```
   git checkout -- Dockerfile.puppeteer app/browser-automation/page.tsx docker-compose.yml documentation/puppeteer_integration_guide.md lib/puppeteer-mcp.ts mcp-servers/configs/puppeteer-config.json
   ```

2. **Create a New Feature Branch**:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/puppeteer-enhancements
   ```

3. **Verify the Puppeteer Server Functionality**:
   ```
   node simple-puppeteer-server.js
   ```
   Then in a new terminal, test with:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:5004/status
   ```

4. **Before Making Changes, Pull Latest Changes from Main**:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout feature/puppeteer-enhancements
   git merge main
   ```

5. **After Implementing New Features, Push to GitHub**:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new Puppeteer enhancements"
   git push origin feature/puppeteer-enhancements
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub to merge your changes from `feature/puppeteer-enhancements` into `main`

## Planned Enhancements

1. Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
2. More sophisticated browser automation capabilities
3. Better integration with educational content
4. Performance optimizations
5. Comprehensive testing suite

This approach ensures we keep the main branch stable while adding new functionality in a separate branch.
