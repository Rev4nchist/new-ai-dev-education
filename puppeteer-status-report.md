# Puppeteer Integration Status Report

## Current Status

We've implemented a Simple Puppeteer Server that provides browser automation capabilities via a REST API:

- The server is implemented in `simple-puppeteer-server.js` and runs on port 5004
- It provides APIs for browser initialization, navigation, interaction (clicking, typing), text extraction, and screenshot capture
- The server has been successfully tested and is functional

## GitHub Repository Status

There appears to be a discrepancy between what's committed to GitHub and what's available in the local working directory. Several Puppeteer-related files that were committed are now showing as "deleted" locally:

- Dockerfile.puppeteer
- app/browser-automation/page.tsx
- docker-compose.yml
- documentation/puppeteer_integration_guide.md
- lib/puppeteer-mcp.ts
- mcp-servers/configs/puppeteer-config.json

## Required Actions for Next Development Session

1. **Restore Missing Files**: Before starting new development, we need to restore the missing Puppeteer-related files from the Git repository.

2. **Create a New Feature Branch**: For future development, we should create a dedicated feature branch (e.g., `feature/puppeteer-enhancements`) to ensure we don't break the working functionality in the main branch.

3. **Verify Functionality**: After restoring files, we should verify that the Puppeteer integration is working correctly by running the server and testing its APIs.

4. **Clean Up Test Files**: Several test files (test-mcp-server.js, test-puppeteer.js, etc.) should be either properly organized or removed to keep the repository clean.

## Next Feature Development Ideas

For the next development session, we could focus on enhancing the Puppeteer integration with features such as:

1. Improved error handling and retry mechanisms
2. More sophisticated browser automation capabilities (form handling, multi-page navigation)
3. Better integration with the educational content of the platform
4. Performance optimizations and resource management
