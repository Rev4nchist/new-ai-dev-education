  - ⏳ Include practical code examples and MCP integration points

### 8. Learning Paths Framework ✅
- **Primary task:** Establish learning path structure
- **Implementation steps:**
  - ✅ Create `/learning-paths/page.tsx` with path selector
  - ⏳ Build individual path pages for each persona
  - ✅ Implement module structure with links to relevant content

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinement (Weeks 6-8) 🔄

### 9. Resources Knowledge Base ✅
- **Primary task:** Build the Cursor Rules knowledge base
- **Implementation steps:**
  - ✅ Create `/resources/knowledge-base/page.tsx`
  - ✅ Implement the Cursor Rules interactive explorer
  - ✅ Build category pages and individual rule pages
  - ✅ Add filtering and search functionality

### 10. Interactive Features ✅
- **Primary task:** Add engaging interactive elements
- **Implementation steps:**
  - ✅ Build code playground component
  - ⏳ Create interactive diagrams for technical concepts
  - ✅ Implement interactive rule explorer for knowledge base

### 11. Contact Page with Screenshot Upload ✅
- **Primary task:** Create support contact page
- **Implementation steps:**
  - ✅ Build `/contact/page.tsx` with form
  - ✅ Implement screenshot upload and processing
  - ✅ Add FAQ section

### 12. Final Enhancements 🔜
- **Primary task:** Polish and optimize
- **Implementation steps:**
  - Implement dark mode refinements
  - Add SEO optimization
  - Optimize performance with lazy loading
  - Conduct cross-browser testing

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Component Strategy
- Build a component library first, focusing on:
  - Typography components (heading levels, body text, code)
  - Layout components (sections, grids, cards)
  - Navigation components (sidebar, breadcrumbs)
  - Interactive elements (accordions, tabs, code blocks)

### Content Management
- Use MDX for content-heavy pages to simplify maintenance
- Implement consistent frontmatter schema for all content:
```
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "SEO description"
complexity: "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced"
lastUpdated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
```

### State Management
- Use React Context for:
  - Theme state (dark/light mode)
  - Navigation state (current section/page)
  - User preferences (if implementing saved progress)

### Performance Considerations
- Implement static generation for documentation pages
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement code splitting for larger interactive components

## Progress Update (Date: Current)

### Completed Items
- ✅ All Phase 1 items have been completed successfully
- ✅ All Phase 2 items have been completed with core structure and templates
- ✅ Core layout and navigation are fully implemented with responsive design
- ✅ Basic content sections (Introduction, MCP) are in place
- ✅ Best Practices section implemented with comprehensive content structure
- ✅ Building MCP Servers section completely implemented with detailed guides
- ✅ Server implementation pages created with comprehensive Node.js guide
- ✅ Python implementation guide created with detailed step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Firebase implementation guide created with serverless architecture approach
- ✅ AI Tools section implemented with comparison features
- ✅ Learning Paths framework established with beginner path detail
- ✅ Resources Knowledge Base with Cursor Rules explorer implemented
- ✅ Contact page with support form and screenshot upload functionality
- ✅ Interactive code playground for experimenting with MCP implementations
- ✅ Sidebar navigation enhanced with hover functionality

### Current Focus
- 🔄 Building out detailed individual learning path pages
- 🔄 Creating interactive diagrams for technical concepts

### Next Steps
- Apply final enhancements and optimizations
- Implement dark mode refinements
- Add SEO optimization

## Getting Started

To kick off this plan, we will begin with:

1. Building the layout and navigation components
2. Implementing the Introduction section
3. Creating the MCP overview page

This approach will establish the foundational structure that can then be expanded with content for each section.
