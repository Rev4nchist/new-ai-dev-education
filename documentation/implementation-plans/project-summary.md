- ✅ Badges and labels for visual categorization

## Remaining Tasks

### Content Population
- ⏳ Add detailed content to all page templates
- ⏳ Create real code examples for server implementation guides
- ⏳ Develop comprehensive learning path content for each persona
- ⏳ Expand the knowledge base with additional resources

### Interactive Elements
- ⏳ Create interactive diagrams for technical concepts
- ⏳ Implement more advanced code playground features (saving, sharing)
- ⏳ Add interactive quizzes and assessments for learning paths

### Final Enhancements
- ⏳ Implement dark mode refinements
- ⏳ Add SEO optimization
- ⏳ Optimize performance with lazy loading
- ⏳ Conduct cross-browser testing
- ⏳ Implement analytics for tracking user engagement

## Next Steps

1. **Content Development**: Focus on populating the existing page templates with comprehensive, educational content.
2. **Interactive Diagrams**: Create visual diagrams to explain complex technical concepts.
3. **Learning Path Completion**: Develop detailed content for each learning path persona.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and other performance enhancements.
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices.

## Technical Implementation

The site is built using:
- Next.js 14 for the framework
- React for the UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI for component library
- TypeScript for type safety

The architecture follows a component-based approach with reusable UI elements and consistent styling throughout the site. The navigation is implemented using a sidebar that collapses on mobile devices, and the content is organized in a logical hierarchy for easy navigation.

## Conclusion

The AI Dev Education site has made significant progress, with all core features implemented and a solid foundation for content development. The remaining tasks focus primarily on content population, interactive enhancements, and final optimizations to ensure a high-quality user experience.
