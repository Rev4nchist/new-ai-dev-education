# Implementation Plan Using Next.js \+ Firebase

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Install Development Tools**  
     
   * Ensure Node.js is installed (use the LTS version compatible with Next.js 14+). Install npm as well.

   

2. **Initialize Git Repository**  
     
   * Create a new project directory (`/ai-dev-edu-platform/`). Initialize a Git repository and create `main` and `dev` branches, configuring branch protection as needed.

   

3. **Set Up Next.js Project with Firebase Setup**  
     
   * Initialize a new Next.js 14 project using the template for Firebase integration:

   

   `npx create-next-app ai-dev-edu-platform --typescript`

   

   * Install Firebase tools and set up Firebase project for hosting and database services.

   

4. **Configure Firebase**  
     
   * Set up Firebase by creating a new project in the Firebase console.  
   * Install Firebase in your project:

   

   `npm install firebase`

   

   * Initialize Firebase in your app by configuring Firebase services with a `firebaseConfig.js` file.

   

5. **Install and Configure Tailwind CSS**  
     
   * Inside the project directory, install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies via npm:

   

   `npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init`

   

   * Configure `tailwind.config.js` to include your custom color palette:  
       
     * charcoal gray: `#444`  
     * blue: `#3B82F6`  
     * purple: `#5F4BDD`  
     * orange: `#FF7D4D`

   

6. **Set Up TypeScript Environment**  
     
   * Ensure TypeScript is installed and configured within the project. Create or adjust `tsconfig.json` for proper settings.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1. **Create Global Layout and Navigation**  
     
   * In `app/layout.tsx`, define the global layout with a focus on accessibility, using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

   

2. **Develop Static Educational Content Pages**  
     
   * Utilize the `pages/` directory to create static pages displaying various educational content.  
   * Example: `pages/learning-paths.tsx` and `pages/mcp-docs.tsx` for different learning paths and MCP documentation.

   

3. **Implement Firebase Authentication Integration (if required in the future)**  
     
   * Set up authentication using Firebase Auth, allowing potential additions for user login.

   

4. **Implement Chat UI Components**  
     
   * Develop the main chat components inspired by the provided architecture.  
   * **ChatContainer**: Display chat messages.  
   * **ChatInput**: Capture user inputs.  
   * **FloatingChat**: Toggle chat visibility.

   

5. **Integrate Firebase Firestore for Chat History Persistence**  
     
   * Set up Firestore to save chat history so that the conversations persist across user sessions and interactions.

   

6. **Validate Frontend Components**  
     
   * Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and validate that all components render as expected and are styled correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend (API Integration)

1. **Integrate OpenRouter API Client**  
     
   * Use the OpenRouter API client inside your Next.js API routes to handle chat completions and other interactions.

   

2. **Create and Configure .env.local File for Environment Variables**  
     
   * Store sensitive information such as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and Firebase keys in this file.

   

3. **Verify API Endpoint with Firebase Functions**  
     
   * Optionally, utilize Firebase Functions to serve as an alternate backend for additional flexibility.

   

4. **Implement Error Handling for Missing API Key**  
     
   * Implement error warnings or fallbacks if the OpenRouter API key or Firebase config is missing.

## Phase 4: Integration

1. **Enhance Chat Components with Real API Calls**  
     
   * Finalize chat input behavior by integrating it with the OpenRouter API for realistic interaction simulations.

   

2. **Link ChatContainer with Real-time Firestore Updates**  
     
   * Utilize Firestore to update the chat container in real time with messages received from API responses.

   

3. **Validate Chat Workflow**  
     
   * Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the chat functionality works seamlessly with the API and Firestore.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1. **Finalize Next.js and Firebase Hosting Configuration**  
     
   * Configure the `next.config.js` for deployment:

   

   `module.exports = { images: { unoptimized: true }, reactStrictMode: true, };`

   

2. **Deploy to Vercel and Firebase Hosting**  
     
   * Deploy your project to Vercel for static page hosting and Firebase for database functionality.  
   * Ensure environment variables are set correctly during deployment.

   

3. **Post-deployment Validation**  
     
   * Ensure all features are functional on the live site, checking that educational content loads, chat features work, and Firebase functions operate correctly.

## Final Validations

1. **Accessibility Testing**  
     
   * Use tools like Lighthouse to check against WCAG standards for accessibility improvements.

   

2. **Full Functional Testing**  
     
   * Traverse through all educational content, interact with the chat feature fully to ensure robust integration.

   

3. **Prepare Documentation**  
     
   * Document setup instructions, architecture details, and key operational guidelines for future developers.

   

4. **Final Code Review and Cleanup**  
     
   * Conduct a thorough code review, clean the codebase where necessary, and prepare for version tagging.

By following this structured plan, the AI-Dev Education Platform will achieve a robust implementation using Next.js and Firebase, ensuring scalability and a comprehensive user experience for learning AI-assisted development.
