# AI Dev Education Test Standards

This document outlines the testing standards and practices for the AI Dev Education project, following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Test-Driven Development Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Tests First**: Write tests before implementing code
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Start with failing tests, make them pass, then refactor
3. **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to make tests pass
4. **Incremental Progress**: Build functionality through small, testable increments
5. **Continuous Verification**: Run tests frequently to ensure continued functionality

### Benefits
- Clarifies requirements before implementation
- Creates a safety net for future changes
- Improves code design and reduces coupling
- Prevents regression bugs
- Serves as living documentation

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions, methods, or components in isolation
- **Tools**: JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- **Examples**:
  - Testing utility functions
  - Testing component rendering
  - Testing input validation

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interaction between components or systems
- **Tools**: JavaScript testing frameworks with DOM testing capabilities
- **Examples**:
  - Testing API interactions
  - Testing component interactions
  - Testing data flow between modules

### 3. UI Tests
- **Purpose**: Test user interface behavior and appearance
- **Tools**: Visual regression testing tools, browser automation
- **Examples**:
  - Testing responsive layouts
  - Testing user interactions
  - Testing visual appearance

### 4. Accessibility Tests
- **Purpose**: Ensure content is accessible to all users
- **Tools**: Accessibility testing tools (axe, pa11y)
- **Examples**:
  - Testing screen reader compatibility
  - Testing keyboard navigation
  - Testing color contrast

### 5. Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Measure and ensure adequate performance
- **Tools**: Performance profiling tools, Lighthouse
- **Examples**:
  - Testing page load times
  - Testing rendering performance
  - Testing resource loading

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure
1. **Setup**: Prepare the test environment
2. **Exercise**: Execute the code being tested
3. **Verify**: Check that the expected behavior occurred
4. **Cleanup**: Reset the environment for the next test

### Naming Conventions
- Test files should be named `[component/function]_test.js` or `[component/function].test.js`
- Test descriptions should be clear and specific
- Use a consistent pattern: `describe('Component/Function', () => { it('should do something specific', () => {...}) })`

### Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage of critical functionality
- Focus on behavior rather than implementation details
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Document any areas intentionally not covered by tests

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Definition
- Clearly define the feature to be implemented
- Document acceptance criteria and requirements
- Identify edge cases and potential issues

### 2. Test Planning
- Identify what types of tests are needed
- Plan the test structure and assertions
- Consider dependencies and testing approach

### 3. Test Creation
- Write tests that verify the expected behavior
- Ensure tests are initially failing (red)
- Document test purpose and expectations

### 4. Implementation
- Write minimal code to make tests pass (green)
- Focus on functionality, not optimization
- Verify each test passes as implementation progresses

### 5. Refactoring
- Improve code structure and quality
- Maintain test passing state during refactoring
- Eliminate code duplication and improve readability

### 6. Verification
- Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Document test coverage and results
- Review implementation against requirements

## Test Documentation

### For Each Feature
- Document the tests created for the feature
- Explain testing approach and coverage
- Note any limitations or assumptions

### Test Results
- Document test execution results
- Track test coverage metrics
- Identify any failing tests and their causes

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- Configure tests to run automatically on code changes
- Set up continuous integration to execute tests
- Ensure test results are visible to the team

### Test Maintenance
- Keep tests up to date as requirements change
- Refactor tests when necessary for maintainability
- Remove obsolete tests when features change

## Project-Specific Testing Guidelines

### Content Testing
- Validate HTML structure and semantics
- Check content completeness against requirements
- Verify educational accuracy of content

### Chatbot Testing
- Test API integration with OpenRouter.ai
- Verify error handling and fallbacks
- Test conversation flow and context maintenance

### Search Functionality Testing
- Test search index creation and updates
- Verify search result accuracy and relevance
- Test search performance with various query lengths

### Responsive Design Testing
- Test layouts at standard breakpoints
- Verify touch interactions on mobile devices
- Test navigation usability across devices

### Dark Mode Testing
- Test appearance in both light and dark modes
- Verify proper color contrast in both modes
- Test mode switching and preference persistence

By following these testing standards, we ensure the AI Dev Education website is developed with quality, maintainability, and reliability as primary considerations.
